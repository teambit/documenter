import { LinkedHeading } from './linked-heading';

Links are used as navigational elements. They can be used on their own or inline, as part of a paragraph.  
They provide a lightweight option for navigation that should be used sparingly so as to not clutter a page and make it difficult for users to identify their next steps.

Using the Linked Heading component:

```js live
<>
  <LinkedHeading link="link-here-1">A default linked title</LinkedHeading>

  <LinkedHeading link="link-here-2" size="xs">
    An extra small linked title
  </LinkedHeading>
</>
```
